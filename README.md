# Medieval Fantasy City Generator

This project is an open-source medieval fantasy city generator based on the original [Medieval Fantasy City Generator](https://watabou.itch.io/medieval-fantasy-city-generator/) (also available [here](http://fantasycities.watabou.ru/?size=15&seed=682063530)). This version has been updated to be compatible with the latest versions of the Lime and OpenFL libraries.

This is the very old version 8 years old fixed and improved.

## Prerequisites

To install and run this medieval city generator, you will need:

1. **Haxe** (version 4.2.0 or higher)

   * [Download Haxe from the official website](https://haxe.org/download/)
   * Make sure it is added to your PATH after installation

2. **Haxelib** (comes with Haxe)

3. **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

   * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Repository

```powershell
# Using Git
git clone https://github.com/kroryan/TownGeneratorOS.git
cd TownGeneratorOS

# Or download the ZIP manually and extract it
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt on Windows) and run:

```powershell
# Install Lime
haxelib install lime 8.0.0
haxelib run lime setup

# Install OpenFL
haxelib install openfl 9.2.0
haxelib run openfl setup

# Install msignal
haxelib install msignal 1.2.5
```

### 3. Verify the Installation

To check that everything is correctly installed:

```powershell
haxelib list
```

You should see the installed libraries with their versions:

* lime: \[8.0.0]
* openfl: \[9.2.0]
* msignal: \[1.2.5]

### 4. Compile and Run the Project

#### For HTML5 (web browser)(This way you can use it with azgaar i have an azgaar repository with a branch call TOTALOCAL you can use that one, it is ready):

```powershell
haxelib run openfl test html5
```

This will compile the project and open it in your default browser, usually at `http://localhost:3000`.

#### For desktop application (Neko):

```powershell
haxelib run openfl test neko
```

#### For Windows:

```powershell
haxelib run openfl test windows
```

## Changes Made to Fix Compatibility Issues

The following changes were implemented to solve compatibility problems with the current versions of Lime and OpenFL:

### 1. Dependency Version Updates

Library versions in `project.xml` were updated:

* Lime updated to version 8.0.0 (previously 7.8.0)
* OpenFL updated to version 9.2.0 (previously 9.0.2)

### 2. Data Type Issues Fixed

Main errors fixed were related to data type incompatibilities:

* `lime.utils.Float32Array`, `lime.utils.Int32Array`, and `lime.utils.UInt32Array` should now be `lime.utils.DataPointer` in certain contexts
* `openfl.utils.ByteArray` should be `lime.utils.Bytes` or `lime.utils.BytePointer` depending on context
* Deprecated references to `lime.math.ColorMatrix` and `lime.math.Matrix4` now use `lime.utils.ArrayBufferView`

### 3. Syntax Updates

Most warnings (that did not prevent compilation) were related to obsolete syntax:

* `@:enum abstract` is deprecated and should be replaced with `enum abstract`
* `@:extern` is deprecated and should be replaced with `extern`

Although these warnings appear in library code, not project code, they do not affect functionality.

### 4. WebGL/OpenGL API Fixes

Types in the WebGL/OpenGL APIs were fixed to be compatible with new versions:

* Adjustments in `WebGL2RenderContext` and `NativeOpenGLRenderContext` to use correct types in function arguments

## Using the Generator

1. **Main Interface**: When running the application, you will see an interface where you can select parameters for your city.

2. **City Generation**:

   * Select the city size
   * Click generate to create a new random city

3. **Exploration**:

   * Zoom using the mouse wheel
   * Drag to move around the map
   * The interface includes buttons to generate new cities or modify parameters

## Common Troubleshooting

### Error Installing Lime or OpenFL

If you encounter errors during Lime or OpenFL installation, try:

```powershell
haxelib run lime setup -y
haxelib run openfl setup -y
```

### Compilation Errors

If you encounter type-related errors, verify you are using the correct versions of Lime (8.0.0) and OpenFL (9.2.0) as specified in this README.

### Runtime Errors

If the app compiles but crashes when running, it may be due to:

* Missing resources in the `Assets` folder
* Browser incompatibility (try Chrome if using HTML5)
* WebGL configuration issues on your system

## üè∞ Desktop Application (Electron)

In addition to the web version, this project now includes a **complete desktop application** built with Electron that serves as both a standalone desktop app and a local web server.

### Features of the Desktop Application

* **Standalone Desktop App**: Native window with proper menus and icons
* **Local Web Server**: Automatically starts a web server on port 3000
* **Beautiful Loading Screen**: Medieval-themed loading interface with progress indicators
* **Auto-reload System**: Intelligent reloading at 5s and 12s to ensure proper initialization
* **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows and Linux
* **No Internet Required**: Works completely offline

### Desktop Application Installation

#### Prerequisites for Desktop App

1. **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
   * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
   * Verify installation: `node --version`

2. **NPM** (comes with Node.js)
   * Verify installation: `npm --version`

#### Quick Setup for Desktop App

```powershell
# Navigate to the electron app directory
cd electron-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the web application
npm run build-web

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# OR run in production mode
npm start
```

### Web Build System

The desktop application includes an automated web build system that compiles the Haxe/OpenFL project and copies it to the electron app directory.

#### Using the Web Build Script

**From the electron-app directory:**
```powershell
cd electron-app

# Build web application (recommended method)
npm run build-web

# OR run the script directly
node build-web.js
```

**From the project root directory:**
```powershell
# Build web application from root
cd electron-app && npm run build-web && cd ..

# OR combine with Haxe build
haxelib run openfl build html5 && cd electron-app && npm run build-web && cd ..
```

#### What the Web Build Script Does

1. **Compiles Haxe Project**: Runs `haxelib run openfl build html5` 
2. **Locates Build Output**: Finds the compiled files in `Export/html5/bin/`
3. **Copies Files**: Copies all web files to `electron-app/web-build/`
4. **Verifies Build**: Ensures `index.html` and `TownGenerator.js` are present
5. **Reports Status**: Shows success/failure with file paths

#### Manual Web Build (Alternative)

If you prefer to build manually:
```powershell
# 1. Build the Haxe project first
haxelib run openfl build html5

# 2. Copy files manually
cd electron-app
Remove-Item -Path "web-build" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Copy-Item -Path "..\Export\html5\bin" -Destination "web-build" -Recurse

# 3. Verify the build
if (Test-Path "web-build\index.html") { 
    Write-Host "Web build completed successfully" 
} else { 
    Write-Host "Web build failed" 
}
```

#### Troubleshooting Web Build

**Common Issues:**

```powershell
# If build fails, clean and retry
cd electron-app
Remove-Item -Path "web-build" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
cd ..
haxelib run openfl clean html5
haxelib run openfl build html5
cd electron-app
npm run build-web
```

**Build Script Errors:**
- Ensure you're in the correct directory (`electron-app/`)
- Verify the parent directory contains the OpenFL project
- Check that `Export/html5/bin/` exists after Haxe compilation
- Make sure Node.js has file system permissions

### Compiling Desktop Application

#### For Windows

```powershell
cd electron-app

# Build web application first
npm run build-web

# Compile for Windows (creates installer and portable versions)
npm run build-win
```

This creates:
* **NSIS Installer**: `dist/Medieval-Fantasy-City-Generator Setup 1.0.0.exe`
* **Portable Version**: `dist/Medieval-City-Generator-Portable-1.0.0.exe`

#### For Linux

```powershell
cd electron-app

# Build web application first
npm run build-web

# Compile for Linux
npm run build-linux
```

This creates:
* **AppImage**: `dist/Medieval-Fantasy-City-Generator-1.0.0.AppImage`
* **DEB Package**: `dist/medieval-fantasy-city-generator_1.0.0_amd64.deb`

#### For Both Platforms

```powershell

## Additional Technical Notes

* Errors like `lime.utils.X should be lime.utils.DataPointer` relate to Lime API changes where specific typed arrays must now be treated as generic data pointers.

* Warnings about `@:enum abstract` and `@:extern` are syntax changes in Haxe that do not affect functionality but indicate libraries use deprecated syntax.

* The default port for HTML5 mode is 3000 but may change if that port is busy.
